        <h1>St. Philomena's Cathedral</h1>
        <p>One of the largest cathedrals in India, St. Philomena's Cathedral in Mysuru is a remarkable example of Gothic architecture. The majestic church, built to honour the memory of Saint Philomena, a Latin Catholic Saint of the Roman Catholic Church, draws inspiration from the beautiful Cologne Cathedral of Germany. Remains of St Philomena are preserved at the cathedral. St. Philomena's Cathedral is one of the tallest churches in Asia.
St Philomena's Cathedral was built by Maharaja of Mysuru Mummudi Krishnaraja Wadiyar in 1843 in memory of 4th-century saint and martyr St. Philomena. The cathedral was built as a gift to a large number of European populations residing in Mysuru in the 19th century. As the need for a larger church was felt due to the growing population of Europeans, the foundation for the new church was laid in October 1933 by the Mysuru, then king of Krishnarajendra Wodeyar.
St Philomena's Cathedral was designed by a French architect, Daly, to resemble Cologne Cathedral in Germany.</p>
